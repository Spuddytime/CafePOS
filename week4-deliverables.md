## Tasks to perform in this lab
- Define the OrderObserver and OrderPublisher interface
- Modify the Order class to act as a publisher that can register, unregister, and notify
  observers
- Implement concrete observers such as KitchenDisplay, DeliveryDesk, and
  CustomerNotifier
- Implement a CLI demo (Week4Demo) that demonstrates order events triggering
  notifications to multiple observer
- Write JUnit tests using a fake observer to confirm that order events are propagated
  correctly.
